 * Strict mode canâ€™t automatically detect side effects for you, but it can help you spot them by making them a little more deterministic. This is done by intentionally double-invoking these functions:
 * - Class component: constructor, render, shouldComponentUpdate, getDerivedStateFromProps
 * - Function component: its body,
 * - State updater functions (the first argument to setState)
 * - Functions passed to useState, useMemo, or useReducer
 * This only applies to development mode. Lifecycles will not be double-invoked in production mode.
